# Training Data Comparison Report

**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Test Set:** Last 80 games of 2026 season  

---

## Executive Summary

This study compares model performance when trained on different datasets:

- **Model A (Historical):** Trained on 2024-2025 data (80 test games evaluated)
- **Model B (2026-Only):** Trained only on 2026 data available before holdout
- **Model C (Combined):** Trained on all available historical + 2026 data

**Hypothesis:** Historical training should help because more data is available, but rosters 
change year-to-year which might reduce its value.

## Results Summary

| Metric | Historical (2024-25) | 2026-Only | Combined | Best |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|----------|------|
| Moneyline Accuracy | 53.8% | 60.3% | 60.3% | 2026-Only |
| Totals MAE | 6.24 | 6.47 | 6.47 | Historical |
| Margin MAE | 5.15 | 6.35 | 6.29 | Historical |
| Home Run MAE | 4.24 | 4.49 | 4.45 | Historical |
| Away Run MAE | 3.64 | 4.30 | 4.28 | Historical |

## Detailed Analysis

### Moneyline Accuracy

Who wins the game?

- **Historical:** 53.8%
- **2026-Only:** 60.3%  
- **Combined:** 60.3%

### Total Runs MAE

Average error in predicted total runs:

- **Historical:** 6.24 runs
- **2026-Only:** 6.47 runs
- **Combined:** 6.47 runs

### Margin/Spread MAE

Average error in predicted game margin:

- **Historical:** 5.15 runs  
- **2026-Only:** 6.35 runs
- **Combined:** 6.29 runs

## Key Findings

### Does Historical Data Help?

**2026-only data is more predictive.**

Current season data is more relevant than historical data. This suggests roster changes
significantly affect team quality, making old data less useful.

### Training Data Size Effects

| Model | Training Games | Teams with Stats |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Historical | ~5,800 | ~300+ |
| 2026-Only | ~80 | ~20 |
| Combined | ~6,100 | ~300+ |

The 2026-only model has **far less training data**, yet performs worse. 
This suggests current form matters.

## Recommendation

**🏆 Recommended Approach: Historical (2024-2025)**

Use historical data as the foundation. Early in the season when 2026 
sample sizes are small, the historical model provides more stable estimates. As the season 
progresses and more 2026 games are played, the combined approach may become better.


---

## Caveats

1. **Small test set:** Only 80 games in the holdout set. Results may vary with more data.
2. **Early season:** 2026 season just started; teams are still establishing their level.
3. **Simple model:** Used basic run prediction; more sophisticated models (Elo, neural nets) 
   might show different patterns.
