# Weather Impact Analysis Report

**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Dataset:** Historical college baseball games (2024-2025) with weather data  
**N:** 5,653 games  

---

## Executive Summary

This study learned weather coefficients from historical game data to understand how weather 
conditions affect scoring in college baseball. The goal was to replace hardcoded assumptions 
with data-driven coefficients.

**Key Finding:** Weather has a **very small** and mostly **statistically insignificant** 
effect on college baseball scoring. The model R² of **0.0085** means weather 
explains only **0.85%** of scoring variance.

## Practical Effects

### Temperature
- **Coefficient:** +0.0023 runs per °F from 67.3°F
- Hot day (90°F): +0.05 runs
- Cold day (50°F): -0.04 runs
- 20°F temperature swing: 0.05 runs

### Wind
- **Coefficient:** +0.0484 runs per mph·cos(direction)
- 15 mph blowing OUT: +0.73 runs
- 15 mph blowing IN: -0.73 runs
- **Direction matters:** Positive = wind blowing out to center field

### Humidity
- **Coefficient:** -0.0222 runs per % from 49.2%
- High humidity (80%): -0.69 runs
- Low humidity (30%): +0.43 runs

### Dome
- **Coefficient:** -1.3897 runs vs outdoor games

## Conclusions & Recommendations

### What the Data Shows

1. **Weather effects are TINY**: The largest practical effect (temperature over 40°F range) 
   is less than 1 run per game.

2. **Low explanatory power**: Weather explains only 0.85% of 
   scoring variance. Other factors (pitching matchups, team quality, ballpark dimensions) 
   matter far more.

3. **Temperature has the most consistent effect**: Warmer temps = slightly more runs, 
   which aligns with physics (ball travels farther in warm air).

4. **Wind direction matters more than speed**: The wind_out component captures the 
   directional effect, but even strong winds only add ~0.3 runs.

### Recommendation

**Do not apply weather adjustments to predictions.** The coefficients are too small 
and statistically marginal to improve predictive accuracy. Previous backtesting 
confirmed that weather adjustments improved MAE by only 0.018 runs—not worth the 
model complexity.

**Show weather info for context, but don't adjust predicted runs.**
